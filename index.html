<h3>Project Description</h3>
TournamentBuzz is an application designed to facilitate the organization of tournaments. Current methods of organizing tournaments,
such as writing down a bracket on paper and pencil or using software such as IMLeagues are cluttered or inaccessible to smaller organizations.
Paper and pencil methods of organizing tournaments puts a large amount of effort on the organizer to manually sign teams up and organize the matches.
Additionally, this method restricts the viewing of the matches and scores to whoever has the papers, restricting access to the players and fans of the event.
Other online methods such as IMLeagues or IMTrack are either cluttered, slow, and riddled with advertisements or are very expensive,
restricting usability and access by smaller organizations. Our approach to this problem is a simple, flexible, and open-source solution that is cross platform
and easily accessible to organizations of all sizes. Our application will allow for players to sign up for tournaments, referees to manage and score them,
and spectators to view the tournaments and their scores and results.
